# Web-Automation-Experimental
This basic Java project combines romankh3's [image-comparison library](https://github.com/romankh3/image-comparison) with Selenium for testing of browser applications.

As the title states and until I rethink otherwise, I use this project only for experimenting. Feel free to take it and to modify it however you please.

Note that I am developing and testing it only on MacOS. I am yet to discover if it would work out-of-the-box on Windows.
